Repository contains the game itself and the editor to create new levels easily and quickly. Both applications have no dependencies. All the code is written from the scratch.

# Installation
To start the game you need to install **yarn** package manager firstly (if you still didn't). Please, visit [the official documentation website](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) and follow the instructions.

When **yarn** is installed, type the commands below:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Enet/unicorn-runner.git
cd unicorn-runner
yarn install
```

# Start
To start the game:
```sh

Good luck and have fun! :frog:
